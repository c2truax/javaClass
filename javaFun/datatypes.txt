Primitive Types
Here are the most-used primitive types in Java:

int: An int holds integers, like 4 or -51. It is limited to numbers between -2147483648 and 2147483647, or around 2 billion.
long: These are for larger integers up to 2^63, or around 2 quintillion.
boolean: A boolean represents one of two values: true or false.
double:  Doubles are for floating point numbers like 3.14159265. We will use double rather than float almost exclusively, because they are far more precise.
char: The char data type is used to store a single character, like '$' or 'A'.
Object Types
In addition to the primitive data types, the Java programming language also has object types. Some examples:

Integer: The Integer class wraps a value of the primitive type int into an object.
Long: The Long class wraps a value of the primitive type long in an object.
Boolean: The Boolean class wraps a value of the primitive type boolean in an object.
Double: The Double class wraps a value of the primitive type double in an object.
Character: The Character class wraps a value of the primitive type char in an object.
String: Represents a sequence of characters, like a Python string.
BigInteger: Represents an integer that can be any size at all.
Notice that primitive types are lowercase, while object types are capitalized.
